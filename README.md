<li class="" data-end="1281" data-start="884">
<p class="" data-end="1281" data-start="887"><strong data-end="923" data-start="887">Silymarin (Milk Thistle Extract)</strong><br data-end="926" data-start="923" /> Silymarin is renowned for its liver-protective properties. It aids in detoxification by stimulating the production of vital liver enzymes and antioxidants, which help clear toxins from the liver. Additionally, silymarin supports the regeneration of damaged liver cells, enhancing overall liver function and health.</p>

<p class="" data-end="1773" data-start="1286"><strong data-end="1297" data-start="1286">Betaine</strong><br data-end="1300" data-start="1297" /> Betaine supports liver detoxification by assisting in the breakdown of fats and reducing the accumulation of harmful substances within the liver. It helps reverse liver damage by promoting the repair of liver cells and protecting against fatty liver disease. Moreover, betaine aids in weight loss by enhancing the liver&rsquo;s ability to metabolize fats efficiently, leading to a reduction in overall body fat and improved energy levels.</p>
</li>
<li class="" data-end="2237" data-start="1775">
<p class="" data-end="2237" data-start="1778"><strong data-end="1793" data-start="1778">Glutathione</strong><br data-end="1796" data-start="1793" /> Glutathione, often referred to as the body's master antioxidant, plays a pivotal role in supporting liver detoxification and regeneration. It helps neutralize free radicals and remove toxins, thereby protecting liver cells from damage. By maintaining optimal levels of glutathione, the liver&rsquo;s capacity to burn fat efficiently is enhanced, contributing to weight loss and improved metabolic function.</p>
</li>
<li class="" data-end="2553" data-start="2239">
<p class="" data-end="2553" data-start="2242"><strong data-end="2283" data-start="2242">Camellia Sinensis (Green Tea Extract)</strong><br data-end="2286" data-start="2283" /> Green tea extract contains caffeine and polyphenols that support weight loss and reduce stress. The antioxidant EGCG in green tea may also inhibit enzymes that facilitate the absorption and digestion of fats and carbohydrates.</p>
</li>
<li class="" data-end="2793" data-start="2555">
<p class="" data-end="2793" data-start="2558"><strong data-end="2573" data-start="2558">Resveratrol</strong><br data-end="2576" data-start="2573" /> Resveratrol supports fat-burning and boosts metabolism. It enhances metabolic function and contributes to improved overall health by aiding in the efficient processing of fats.</p>
</li>
<li class="" data-end="3087" data-start="2795">
<p class="" data-end="3087" data-start="2798"><strong data-end="2811" data-start="2798">Genistein</strong><br data-end="2814" data-start="2811" /> Genistein is a soy isoflavone that aids in weight loss by suppressing food intake and improving systemic metabolism. It can promote the transformation of white fat to brown fat, which enhances thermogenesis and supports weight loss.</p>
</li>
<li class="" data-end="3396" data-start="3089">
<p class="" data-end="3396" data-start="3092"><strong data-end="3112" data-start="3092">Chlorogenic Acid</strong><br data-end="3115" data-start="3112" /> Chlorogenic acid helps regulate glucose levels, supports lipid metabolism, and improves liver function. It is beneficial for managing insulin resistance, reducing cardiovascular disease risk, and supporting individuals with type 2 diabetes.</p>
</li>
<li class="" data-end="3638" data-start="3398">
<p class="" data-end="3638" data-start="3401"><strong data-end="3412" data-start="3401">Choline</strong><br data-end="3415" data-start="3412" /> Choline is vital for preventing fat accumulation in the liver.
